    <h2>Introduction about Deforestation</h2>
    <p>
      Forests are an important part of our planet. They provide homes for animals, clean the air we breathe, and help control the climate.
      But every year, large areas of forests are being cut down or destroyed. This is called deforestation.
      On this website, you will learn about why deforestation happens, how it affects the Earth, and what we can do to help protect our forests.

      <h2>What is Deforestation?</h2>
    <p>
      Deforestation is a serious problem because it harms the balance of nature. Trees play a big role in absorbing carbon dioxide and giving us oxygen. When they are cut down, the air becomes more polluted and the Earth gets warmer. That’s why we must act now to save our forests before it’s too late.
